> This is a link to the CRFSuite library written by Naoaki Okazaki. CRF or Conditional Random Fields are a class of statistical modeling method often applied in pattern recognition and machine learning and used for structured prediction.

# Installation

For most "standard" use cases (on Mac, Linux, or Windows on a x86 or x64 processor), `node-crfsuite` will install nice and easy with:

> npm install crfsuite --save

# API Usage

See [docs](http://node-crfsuite.rtfd.io) and [examples](./examples).

## CRFSuite Tagger

```js
const crfsuite = require('crfsuite')
const tagger = crfsuite.Tagger()

let is_opened = tagger.open('./path/to/crf.model')
console.log('File model is opened:', is_opened)

let tags = tagger.tag(input)
console.log('Tags: ', tags)
```

## CRFSuite Trainer

```js
const path = require('path')
const crfsuite = require('crfsuite')
const trainer = crfsuite.Trainer()

let model_filename = path.resolve('./model.crfsuite')

let xseq = [['walk'], ['walk', 'shop'], ['clean', 'shop']]
let yseq = ['sunny', 'sunny', 'rainy']

// submit training data to the trainer
trainer.append(xseq, yseq)
trainer.train(model_filename)

// output: ./model.crfsuite
```

# Installation Special Cases

We use [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) to compile and publish binaries of the library for most common use cases (Linux, Mac, Windows on standard processor platforms). If you have a special case, `node-crfsuite` will work, but it will compile the binary during the install. Compiling with nodejs is done via [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) which requires Python 2.x, so please ensure you have it installed and in your path for all operating systems. Python 3.x will not work.

* See [node-gyp installation prerequisites](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).

## Build from source

```bash
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/vunb/node-crfsuite.git

# go to working folder
cd node-crfsuite

# install dependencies and tools
npm install

# build node-crfsuite from source
npm run build

# run unit-test
npm test
```

## Electron

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is a framework for creating cross-platform desktop applications. It comes with its own version of the Node.js runtime.

If you require `crfsuite` as a dependency for an Electron project, you must compile it for the version of Electron your project's using.

When you first install `crfsuite` it will compile against the version of Node.js on your machine, not against the Node.js runtime bundled with Electron.

To recompile `crfsuite` (or any native Node.js module) for Electron, you can use `electron-rebuild`; more info at Electron's [README](https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild/blob/master/README.md) and [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md).

1. Run `npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild`
2. Add `electron-rebuild` to your project's package.json's install hook
3. Run `npm install`
